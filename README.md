# Overview
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

# Objective
To create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions

# Directory Structure
There are 5 files in the directory that are related with the database.
- Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb
- etl.py: The main runable Python to extract, transform, and load the data into the database.
- sql_queries.py: A Python script containing related queries.
- test.py: A runable Python to test three queries of getting example results from the database.
- READMEA.md: A brief introduction to the directory.

# Usage
- run `Python etl.py`
- run `Python test.py` to check the sample results.
